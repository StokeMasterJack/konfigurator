simplify looses information


exp.assign is more like and-ing

simplify(with affecting assignments):
    return an expression with fewer vars
    will never add vars

assign
    will never decrease the number of vars
    may add vars
    is equiv to and'ing

    assign happens in two cases:
        1. an interactive user session:
              val newCsp = csp.assign(a,b,!c)
        2. split (as part of isSat, satCount, allSat or dnnf compile)
